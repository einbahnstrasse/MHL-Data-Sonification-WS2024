    "- Time (in milliseconds) dummy!\n",

    "Unlike the Python scripts we have been making in VS Code, in Jupyter we can evaluate individual blocks of code, rather than evaluating the entire script at once (by running the script on the Terminal). We can also mix code with markdown instructions, and we can test blocks of code easily this way. \n",

    "Functions are **self contained modules of code** that accomplish a specific task. They usually 'take in' data as input, process it, and 'return' a result as output. We can use a programming language's built-in functions, such as `print()` or `prompt()` to process data, but we can also **define our own functions**. Doing so helps us work more efficiently by allowing us to **consolidate** and **recycle** our code. To make our own function, we must first _define_ it. To utilize that function in our programming, we must _call_ the function we first _defined_.\n",

The symbol `note` that we put inside the parens is a **parameter** of our function, meaning we are specifying a **placeholder** for one kind of **input data** we will later _pass into_ our function when it is **called** (that is, when the function is _used_). The symbol `return` gives us the **output** of the function. Here, we return the `note` data transposed up by 3 semitones, yielding a pitch interval of a minor third.\n",

Think of it like a _phone call_ â€” the **definition** is like a phone number telling us where the function lives, and the **call** dials the phone number to the correct location. We only need to type the function's name with parens, `minorThird()`, and inside the parens we **pass** input data to the function for processing. The input data can be a _harcoded value_, like we typed here, or we can use _variables_ to pass _dynamically changing_ input. We can reference our function anywhere inside our code and as often as we want, **recycling its functionality** whenever we need it. We can write it on a single line as we've done above, or we can _place a call to our function_ inside a control loop, a conditional, or anywhere else!  \n",
